the site you are currently browsing. feeling like this could grow to accompany other things as well or maybe leave it as an index?

memory.elliott.computer	
i'm not sure if blog is the right word. more of a grounding place that i can use for writing and posting. something to hold very small and long threads or just an image or a video i've taken. i was inspired by zinzy.website and piperhaywood.com. i think the idea of building something over time is a beautiful one.

magenta.elliott.computer	
:before magenta.elliott.computer this site was called bell kiosk. i was inspired by those cellphone kiosks in malls. what if one of those kiosks just sold bells. then i started thinking about websites as bells. all those bells ringing/silent/muted: phone, computer, website. for some time i thought bells were a nice metaphor for websites.

in the last few years, i've been drawn to the color magenta. i think it began when i visited the dream house's website and the physical space in nyc. that place was part of what prompted my move to nyc in 2017.

i think i'm in my magenta phase right now. just after lime green. purple or #551A8B is the default visited link color.
