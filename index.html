in the last few years, i've been drawn to the color magenta. i think it began when i visited the dream house's website and the physical space in nyc. that place was part of what prompted my move to nyc in 2017.

i think i'm in my magenta phase right now. just after lime green. purple or #551A8B is the default visited link color.
